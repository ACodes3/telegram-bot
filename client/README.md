# Mini-App with Fiat Payment Using Stripe

## Objective

This project demonstrates the integration of third-party services by developing a mini-app for fiat payments using Stripe in test mode. The mini-app is built using React and is connected to a Telegram bot, enabling users to process payments directly through the interface.

- **Stripe Integration**: Utilizes Stripe's test API to securely process fiat payments.
- **Payment Status Feedback**: Displays the result of each payment transaction (success or error) to the user.
- **Telegram Bot Integration**: Connects with a Telegram bot to facilitate payment notifications and interactions.
