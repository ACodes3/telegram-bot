## Subtask 2: Mini-App with Fiat Payment Using Stripe

### Overview

This mini-app includes a React frontend and a Node.js in the backend that allows users to make fiat payments via Stripe.

### Setup

1. **Frontend (React)**:
   - Navigate to the `client` directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Create a `.env` file and add your Stripe public key:
     ```env
     REACT_APP_STRIPE_KEY=your_stripe_public_key_here
     ```

   - Run the React app locally:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

2. **Backend (Node.js/Express)**:
   - Navigate to the `server` directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```

   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Create a `.env` file and add your Stripe secret key:
     ```env
     REACT_APP_STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key_here
     ```

   - Run the backend server locally:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

3. **Deployment**:
   - The backend is deployed on Render. Due to slow response times, it is recommended to run the backend locally for a better experience.

### Known Issues

- **Backend Deployment**: The backend deployment on Render is experiencing slow response times. For a better experience, run the backend locally.
